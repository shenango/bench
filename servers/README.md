## Overview

This repository contains a collection of TCP and UDP RPC servers for
use with Linux, [IX](https://github.com/ix-project/ix),
[Zygos](https://github.com/ix-project/zygos), and
[Arachne](https://github.com/PlatformLab/Arachne). These servers are
based on the [servers used by
Zygos](https://github.com/ix-project/servers), but instead of
implementing the binary memcached protocol, they implement the
protocol used by Shenango's synthetic application.
